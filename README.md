### Hi, I'm Umut - Data Scientist

I enjoy combining my gustos with data. Holding MSc. Applied Data Science at Utrecht University, the Netherlands.

üöÄ **Latest Release: Anti-Money Laundering Analysis**
> 
> [Umut's AML Project](https://umutaml.netlify.app/) This project presents a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) analysis using the SAML-D (Synthetic Anti-Money Laundering Dataset), a cutting-edge dataset developed by Oztas et al. and published in the 2023 IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering. The project employs advanced machine learning techniques including Random Forest, XGBoost, and ensemble methods to achieve a 94.2% detection rate while addressing critical data leakage issues. The interactive web-based dashboard showcases sophisticated visualization techniques including heatmaps, time series analysis, and geographic mapping across 13 countries and 7 payment methods, ultimately providing a production-ready framework for financial institutions to enhance their AML monitoring capabilities while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.
